# Batatabit landing page 
This is the landing page mockup for the Batatabit website. It is entirely made with HTML and CSS. 
As it is intended to be only a visual reference there is no JS integration. 

This project is part of [Platzi's](https://platzi.com/) HTML and CSS courses.

Below you'll find screenshots of how it looks both on mobile and desktop versions, but there is also an active [page](https://asd1495.github.io/Batatabit-Landing-Mockup/) hosting the project.
